                           par2cron Quick Guide
================================================================================

This is not a replacement for the full documentation, find it at:
  https://github.com/desertwitch/par2cron

It is a condensed guide meant to get you started and as a cheatsheet.

================================================================================
Getting installed:
================================================================================

"par2" binary (as part of par2cmdline) must be installed (as dependency).

"par2cron" binary should be installed into a PATH-location (e.g. /usr/bin/),
ensure that it is executable by running "chmod +x" on it before first use.

An example setup involves adding three crontab entries:

  0 1 * * * par2cron create /mnt/storage
  0 3 * * * par2cron verify /mnt/storage
  0 5 * * * par2cron repair /mnt/storage

Where "/mnt/storage" is the directory tree you want protection within.
Ensure enough time between commands, so resource consumption stays minimal.

================================================================================
Getting started with protecting:
================================================================================

Place a "_par2cron" marker file in any folder you want protected. par2cron
creates parity data, periodically verifies integrity, and repairs corruption.

par2cron is suitable mostly only for non-changing content (such as
media/backups). You should use other solutions for often changing content.

================================================================================
Protecting a folder:
================================================================================

  1. Navigate to a folder containing files you want to protect
  2. Create an empty marker file named "_par2cron"
  3. Done - a PAR2 set is created on the next scheduled run!

After creation of the PAR2 set, the marker file is deleted automatically.
PAR2 sets are then verified and repaired with by the set up periodic tasks.

================================================================================
Marker file name modifiers (optional):
================================================================================

Append par2 arguments to the marker file name to override creation defaults
for that folder: (https://github.com/Parchive/par2cmdline#using-par2cmdline)

Marker file name         | Resulting arguments (assuming defaults: -r15 -n1)
-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
_par2cron                | Uses defaults: -r15 -n1
_par2cron_r30            | 30% redundancy: -r30 -n1
_par2cron_q              | Quiet mode added: -r15 -n1 -q
_par2cron_r30_q          | Both changes: -r30 -n1 -q

================================================================================
Marker file content modifiers (optional):
================================================================================

For full override control, you can put YAML directives inside the marker file:

  name: "Ubuntu"        # PAR2 set name (folder mode only)
  args: ["-r30", "-n1"] # Replaces default par2 arguments
  glob: "*.iso"         # Protect only the matching files
  mode: "folder"        # "folder" or "file" (see below)
  verify: true          # Verify PAR2 set as part of creation
  hidden: true          # Create PAR2 set as hidden (dotfiles)

All directives are optional - only specify what you need to override.

================================================================================
Creation modes:
================================================================================

  folder (default): One PAR2 set for entire directory
  file: Separate PAR2 set per file (useful for large files)

================================================================================
Ignoring folders:
================================================================================

  .par2cron-ignore - skip this folder
  .par2cron-ignore-all - skip this folder and all subfolders

A present ignore-file excludes the folder from all par2cron commands.

================================================================================
Re-creating a PAR2 set:
================================================================================

If you added/changed/removed protected files:

1. Delete existing PAR2-related files (see below)
2. Create again a marker file named "_par2cron"
3. Done - a new PAR2 set is created on the next scheduled run

================================================================================
Explanation of the generated files:
================================================================================

Pictures/
|-- beach.jpg
|-- sunset.jpg
|-- Pictures.par2           # PAR2 index file
|-- Pictures.vol00+01.par2  # PAR2 recovery data
|-- Pictures.par2.json      # par2cron manifest
+-- Pictures.par2.lock      # par2cron lockfile

If the amount of visible files bothers you, switch on --hidden creation.
